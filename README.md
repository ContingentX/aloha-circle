# AlohaLive

**Don't just visit Maui. Meet Maui.** — [alohalive.net](https://alohalive.net)

AlohaLive matches incoming visitors with Maui locals, live local causes, and donated experiences — and turns each match into a real action. The physical experience is the **Aloha Circle** at Kahului Airport (OGG). Built for the [Agent Harness Hackathon](https://www.wemakedevs.org/blogs/agent-harness-hackathon-kick-off) (TrueForge × Qodo × Bright Data).

See [PLANFILE.md](PLANFILE.md) for the full plan.

## Structure

| Dir | What |
|-----|------|
| [`/www`](www) | Vite + React website (static build → S3 behind alohalive.net) |
| [`/app`](app) | Expo / React Native mobile app |
| [`/agentharness`](agentharness) | The Aloha Agent: API, continuous Maui Needs Index ingest, matcher |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Start the agent harness (API on :8787 + ingest loop)
cd agentharness && npm install && npm start

# 2. Start the website (proxies /api to :8787)
cd www && npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173

# 3. (optional) Mobile app in Expo Go
cd app && npm install && npx expo start
# in the app, set API base to http://<your-LAN-IP>:8787
```

Sign up as a visitor on the site — you'll get an instant match against the seeded locals/causes. The harness re-ingests CauseSignals continuously from `agentharness/src/sources.json`.
